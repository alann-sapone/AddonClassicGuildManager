Classic Guild Manager for [classicguildmanager.com](https://classicguildmanager.com) website


### About
 
The classic guild manager addon lets you export your character data to the [classicguildmanager.com](https://classicguildmanager.com) website.  This site is where the rest of your guild members can log in and manage their activity.


### Getting Started
 
Getting started is simple, first download the addon here and install it. On the character you want to export inventory for, simply type

> /cgm
The addon will generate a serialized data string which is then copied into the upload portion of the website.
Once uploaded the site will deserialize the string and your character data will be updated.

> /cgm all
To provide additionnal informations about the whole guild, and not just your current character.
Please note that it may take a lot more time to load and your game may freeze (for a whole minute on big guilds...)
